# Javascript F to C assignment
## What I made
I created the equation code from javascript.
## How I made it
I created two variables, f to c by saying "let" .
 I wrote console.log(f + "Ferenheit is equal to " + c.toFixed(2) + "celsius");
 It gives "99Ferenheit is equal to 37.22celsius."
 
 I reffered the codealong file.

## The problems I faced
I had some problems to figure out how to write the equation. 

## How I overcame them
I tried to look at the codealong file, and there was almost same equation which is "const z = 3.141592653589793;
console.log(z.toFixed(5));", and "console.log("yum" + "my"); // "yummy"".
So I used this method.
