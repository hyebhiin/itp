# Javascript reading reflection
## The things I already knew and something I learned from this article
### chapter1
 I honestly all the information was new to me, so I just read article and stored in my brain. Before reading this article, I thought it’s similar with the Terminal which is what we learned in class, but it wasn’t. The Javascript is the programming language, and it is purpose to add funcionality and interactivity to web pages or apps. Unfortunately, there was nothing I already know, all the article was new to me.

### Chapter2
Before this lesson, most of the concepts in JavaScript were new to me. I didn’t know the difference between expressions and statements, so learning that was very helpful. I also found it interesting that semicolons (;) are not always required in JavaScript, unlike in SQL where they are essential.

### Chapter3
I learned that functions play an important role in JavaScript by efficiently handling repetitive tasks and helping to organize code.

### Overall
This article helped me understand some fundamental concepts of JavaScript that I hadn’t known before. Although everything was new to me, I feel more confident about programming basics now. Moving forward, I want to practice writing simple JavaScript programs myself and explore more about how functions and control flow work in real projects.
