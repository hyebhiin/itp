# Haiku assignment
##What I made
I created short Haiku and turned it into AIFF audio file using the `say` command in Terminal.
##How I made it
I wrote the Haiku on Terminal :

I want to sleep  
Swat the files  
Softly, please.
by Masaoka Shiki

Then I ran the following command to generate the audio file:

say - "I want to sleep. Swat the files. Softly, please." -o haiku.aiff

All the codes I found from the class Git&Shell folder.
##The problems I faced
I had some confusion of saving the terminal and how to push the git and write the reflection.
## How I overcame them
I asked to my friends to solve these problems and also I asked to GPT which code should I use to save. (I didn't used GPT for my reflection.)
