# Haiku assignment
##What I made
I created short Haiku and turned it into AIFF audio file using the `say` command in Terminal.
##How I made it
I wrote the Haiku on Terminal :

I want to sleep  
Swat the files  
Softly, please.
by Masaoka Shiki

Then I ran the following command to generate the audio file:

say - "I want to sleep. Swat the files. Softly, please." -o haiku.aiff

All the codes I found from the class Git&Shell folder.
After saving the aiff audio, I opened GitHub desktop and wrote the summary, push to origin.

##The problems I faced
I had some confusion of saving the terminal and how to push the git and write the reflection. Also, I had confusion of how to push the files on GitHub.
## How I overcame them
My upper semester EPD student helped me to solve these problems by giving the file of steps how to push the file.
