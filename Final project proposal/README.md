# Squid game-Room 456

### Sentence Overview
I will use A-Frame to create a 3D version of the Squid Game symbols (○ △ □) and place them inside a pink maze-like space.
The colors and lights in the scene will change to express tension and symbolism, creating an interactive web-based artwork.

###Paragraph Overview
This project will use A-Frame to build a 3D web scene inspired by the Squid Game symbols,  circle, triangle, and square. The reason why I chose squid game, was because I feel like A-frame style was very similar with squid game background. The shapes will be placed in a pink maze-like room where lights and colors slowly change to create a sense of tension and mood. Users will be able to click on the shapes to make them rotate or glow, exploring the space through simple camera movement.


####Will any work as part of this project overlap with any work you are doing outside of this class? For another class? Who is the professor in this class?
No, this project will not overlap with any work I am doing outside of this class or for another course.
It is an independent project created only for LMSC-261.


## Good outcome for your final project
-A working A-Frame scene with the three shapes (○ △ □) and basic lighting.
-Shapes are visible and the camera can move around the scene.

## Better outcome for your final project
-Each shape rotates or changes color when clicked.
-The pink maze background and lighting effects are added.

## Best outcome for your final project
-Lights and colors change based on background sound or rhythm.
-The scene supports full VR mode and can be explored in 360°.
-The finished project is published online through GitHub Pages for public access.


## Outline of steps 
Week 1 (Nov 4 – Nov 10) I will set up my project and plan the design. I will create a simple A-Frame scene and test if it runs correctly in the browser. Then I will sketch where to place the circle, triangle, and square in the space and decide on the pink color palette and lighting style for the maze background.
Week 2 (Nov 11 – Nov 17) I will start building the 3D models and lights. I will add the circle, triangle, and square using A-Frame elements and set up ambient and directional lighting. I will also adjust the camera position and background color to match the pink tone.
Week 3 (Nov 18 – Nov 24) I will focus on interactivity and animation. I will make each shape rotate or change color when clicked and test the A-Frame animation components. I will also check that the camera movement and scene navigation feel smooth.
Week 4 (Nov 25 – Dec 1) I will build the pink maze environment and refine the details. This includes adding boxes and stairs to create the maze-like structure, improving lighting and reflections, and making sure it works on both desktop and mobile browsers.
Week 5 (Dec 2 – Dec 9) I will finish the project and prepare it for submission. I will add sound-reactive color changes if time allows, test VR mode, and upload the project to GitHub Pages. Finally, I will prepare for the class presentation.
