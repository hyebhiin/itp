# Python reading
## One thing I already knew about python
Ch.1 One thing I already knew about Python is that it is a high-level programming language that is easy to read and lets you quickly try out code like calculations and print statements in the interpreter.

Ch.3 One thing I already knew about Python is that it allows you to define and reuse functions easily, which helps make your code more organized and readable.

Ch.5 One thing I already knew about Python is that it uses if, elif, and else statements with boolean expressions to control the flow of a program, deciding which block of code runs depending on conditions.

Ch.10 One thing I already knew about Python is that lists can store multiple items in a single variable and can hold different data types, such as integers, strings, and even other lists.

## One thing did not know about python

Ch.1 One thing I did not know about Python is that if you write a large integer with commas, like 1,000,000, Python interprets it as a sequence of values instead of a single number.

Ch.3 One thing I did not know about Python is that functions themselves are treated as values, you can assign them to variables, pass them as arguments to other functions, and even call them multiple times using another function like do_twice()

Ch.5 One thing I did not know about Python is that you can write chained comparisons like 0 < x < 10, which makes the code more concise and readable than writing 0 < x and x < 10.

Ch.10 One thing I did not know about Python is that list methods like sort() or append() modify the original list in place and return None, while operations like + or sorted() create and return a new list instead of changing the existing one.
