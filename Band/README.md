# Band Proejct
In this project,  me and our group mate created our own band website. 
So we created the band name, some group photos,and the explanation of our band.

## Problem faced
During the project, I faced several difficulties.

The background color of our website was too dark, making it hard to read the text.
I tried changing the font color and centering the text, but it didn’t align properly.

I also had an issue with hyperlinks — when I uploaded the final version, I accidentally placed the folder in the wrong directory, so the shared link didn’t work at first.

Adjusting layout and styling in HTML/CSS was challenging since I’m still learning to code.

## Self Assessment
Although I’m not very skilled at coding yet, I contributed in other ways:
I helped edit the photos, created custom fonts, and removed backgrounds to make our group images look professional.
I also wrote the About Us section and gave creative ideas for the band’s name and concept.
While Ean focused on the main coding, I supported the design and creative direction as much as I could.

## Group Assessment

Our teamwork went very well:
Ean was the main coder. He handled most of the HTML and CSS and used his computer to build the core structure quickly.
Mario worked on choosing fonts, inserting images, and finding design references. He also assisted Ean a lot throughout the process.
